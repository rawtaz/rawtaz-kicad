Usage
-----

To use this library in KiCad, please see [this tutorial](https://josefmtd.com/2018/08/14/adding-github-libraries-in-kicad-english/). Note that instead of using Git to clone the library, you can use the [Download ZIP](https://github.com/rawtaz/rawtaz-kicad/archive/master.zip) button here on GitHub. Using Git is recommended, however.
